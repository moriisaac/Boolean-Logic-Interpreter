# Python Boolean Logic Interpreter
This is a Python interpreter for boolean logic expressions. It allows you to evaluate expressions containing boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT) and variables with boolean values.

# Requirements
This interpreter requires Python 3.6 or later. There are no additional dependencies.

# Installation
You can download the code from the GitHub repository or clone it using Git:

 "git clone https://github.com/yourusername/python-boolean-logic-interpreter.git"
 
# Usage
The interpreter reads boolean logic expressions from a text file and evaluates them. The expressions must be in a simple syntax that supports variables, boolean operators, and parentheses.

Here is an example expression file:

x AND y OR NOT z

To evaluate this expression, run the interpreter and pass the file path as an argument:

python interpreter.py expressions.txt

The interpreter will read the expressions from the file and evaluate them. It will print the result of each expression to the console.

# Syntax
The syntax for boolean expressions is as follows:

Variables: single letters (a-z, A-Z)
Boolean values: True or False
Operators: AND, OR, NOT
Parentheses: ( and )
Here are some example expressions

x AND y
NOT z OR (x AND y)
(x OR y) AND NOT z
